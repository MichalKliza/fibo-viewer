		<dct:abstract>Loans which have collateral posted as security and where that collateral is real estate, and the real estate which makes up the collateral is purchased with the funds loaned. This ontology covers a range of mortgage concepts and parties, along with catewgories of mortgage loan purpose (remortgage, second home etc.)
		Note that much of the material in this ontology will also have been covered in the separate Loan Contracts module, and is to be integrated. The terms here are not intended not be specific to US mortgage loans or HMDA reporting but are more general.</dct:abstract>

If you have someone who is asset rich but cash poor then a traditional view of the mortgage wqould say yoiu must have th ecash to repay the loan, which would not apply in this case: we actually don&apos;t anticipate that you would repay it, maybe not even regular amounts on the loan, but when the loan expires, e.g. when you die, we will recover on the asset in the normal course of events. Not seen as a default but is an expectation that we will recover our funds. See Wikipedia. AKA Lifetime morgtage, seniores (age xxx or older) to release the home equity.</skos:definition>

Corporate can be &quot;resident&quot; in a location. can be regarded sa resident for tax purposes, which seems to be the thing we refer to as &quot;Registration&quot; (new term added today for Incorporated Company). So we have for example the Registered Address determines your residency? In the US most companies are incorporeated in Delaware because they have more lenient requirements. Place of Incorporation is usually their &quot;Place of REsidence&quot; but they may register in various states for various reasons, and in other foreign countries (except where this is a separate leagel entity presumably? MB). So: Is &quot;Resident&quot; the term we generally use for all legal entities or only for natural persons? Domicile is a better word, and is used in the context of corporations as well as natural persons. Examples: in Aus, someone nameless may have changed their place of residence due to issues around aspextos. Similar casinos incorporated in obscure countries.</skos:definition>
