There's not really much of a secondary market - the initial investors would often hold on to these. There is something around Bloomberg - you can go there and see what's available, if someone has a number of notes from a iven tranche, that they are willing to sell. So there's no transpoarency (!!)

This means the term Scrip Issue is as modeled here \"no charge\". But Capitalization becomes close to this in definition. More detail May 25: No change to the par value of the share so why would there be a change inthe capitaliation? Because from an accountingf point of view they change the value of overall capital of the company - they don't change the market value of the conpany but the accountants will record an increase in the issued capital of the company.

They can, but more likely the employ \"Issuers Agent\". That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days.

Usually happens when a company is about to go into administration. Looking at the scneario descried in the SWIFT definition - not clear if this is the only such scenario. Possibly the issuer has to notif ythe shareholders that the offer is being made. The offer is made by the third party but the notice is sent by the issuer (via their agent) and via the registrar who holds the details of who holds all the shares. Example: Lloyds banking group - most shares would be owned by the market, and a small percentage might be held by private investors.

If the company is listed ,then the issuer is also obligated to notify holders that this thing is taking place. If both companies are listed, both have to send out a notificaiton to the market that they are doing this action. So the target company has to notify the market. sothere is a separate message which is the target company notifying its holders that a Tender Offer etc. is taking place. Is this in the ISO 15022 list? Are they both done with the same message? Example: Company B makes a bid in private to Company A. Discussion may go on in private. At some point you have to legally make it clear. So then Company A says \"we are being approached by company B\" and Company B has to put out a message saying \"We are going to try and take over Company B\". Are they the same message? The \"Tender Offer\" message type is rich enough that both things can be conveyed. So when we try to semantically distinguish the message from the action? The party making the bid completes different fields in the message, to those filled in by the target company. This then marks out the semantics of \"This is a bid offer and I am the 3rd party\" or \"I am reporting a bid offer\". Semantically: There is an event and there is a message describing the event. TElling the market about something happening to a company can be something your company is doing, or something causing a change in circumstances. Either way, the issuer of the affected securities has to identify and notify that there is something which might be affecting the price of their securities. May be internal or external things, and either way the issuer has to notify the market." ;

Check: Is this always the duration of the contract or can it be for example a set of time scales (say monthly) ove the life of say a 6 month contract, and take an average?? This is logically possible but we don't know if this is what this is. FpML: A type describing return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index.

Given the lack of standardization in these contracts, there is very little scope for a secondary market in forwards. The price specified in a forward contract for a specific commodity. The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, if the value of the underlying commodity changes, the value of the forward contract becomes positive or negative, depending on the position held. Forwards are priced in a manner similar to futures. Like in the case of a futures contract, the first step in pricing a forward is to add the spot price to the cost of carry (interest forgone, convenience yield, storage costs and interest/dividend received on the underlying). Unlike a futures contract though, the price may also include a premium for counterparty credit risk, and the fact that there is not daily marking to market process to minimize default risk. If there is no allowance for these credit risks, then the forward price will equal the futures price." ;

If it does take place, this will be a transaction for the purchase or sale of the deliverable underlying as defined in the option contract, or some cash equivalent thereof. Further notes: This is not any different from any other kind of derivatives transaction. The Transaction is still defined as the purchase and sale of the underlying even if it is cash settled. It is defined as the swap of the fixed price for the current market price. Would define a reference price for the current market price if it's not a physical settlement. Would for example define the use of a calculation agent. Scenarios: 1. Agree to cash settle even though the underlying is a deliverable 2. Agree to settle cash because it's difficult to get hold of the underlying 3. The underlying is by its nature not deliverable 4. Fx where the deliverable is a currency to cash delivery is synonymous with delivery of the underlying asset, so the underlying observable and the underlying deliverable are the same actual thing. How this is modeled: Cash \"Settlement\" (means cash delivery) is where you take cash instad of delivery of the underlying deliverable. Whatever is going to be delivered there is going to be a reverse transaction at the going market rate. That also covers the use of an index or basket as the underlying.

fibo-der-etd-fut:FutureInstrument owlnames:definition "Agreement to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, a currency or a financial instrument at a particular price on a stipulated future date. A futures contract obligates the buyer to purchase the underlying commodity, currency or financial instrument and the seller to sell it unless the contract is sold to another before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. Further notes: This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option by the exercise date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. Definition origin: Barrons, adapted by EDMC SMER."@en ;

    owlnames:explanatoryNote "The amount of each tranche of the credit facility sums to the total Credit Facility amount. Tranches of the Credit Facility each have a stated purpose. Credit Facility may includes provision of loans, of guarantees, credit finance and other things that can create a credit exposure. Scope of Credit Facility Tranches: Many tranches are for loans. For retail borrowers these would be the only types of tranche. For other types of potential borrowers e.g. corporates, other tranches of credit facility may include for securitized debt (where the potential borrower is a corporation), or for guaranty provision. (detailed note from SME Review 10 Feb 2011) Credit Facility may also have provision of guarantees, credit finance and other things that can create a credit exposure. These are all in the Credit Facility Tranche. Sets terms under which the lender may make a number of tns which may create the redit risk. The tranche may be the creation of the credit risk See also CDO, where the Pf is structured in a way that might then be subject to these considerations. Not the same meaning as Tranches in CDOs. (note ends) PoC (2010) notes (specific to Loan trahche) Note that since this time the scope of these has been extended since credit facility is also relevant to securitized debt, and other cretid exposures (guaranty etc.). The amount of each tranche, summed up. makes up the Credit Facillity amount. Each tranche has a loan type. One or more loans are issued against this transhe Against the loan will be one or more draw downs. Example: Take a tranche for Credit Line. This is $300K. against that $300K tranche, I issue a credit line loan of $200K . Against that loan of $200K I may draw $10K An amount you are good for under agreed termas and conditions. A credit line is not necessarily going to be drawn. Drawn is the Current debt obligation and may change from day to day. Simpler example: Construction Loan Credit Facility of $1M for this person Against a tranche of Construction Loan, I can have $300 tranche of credit facility. NOT A LOAN. Against that tranche of $300K I can create a loan (take a loan) for Construction, of $200K. That loan is also going to be advanced in several draw-downs. Once I complete the 1st phase of construction, for example at the start I get an initial 10$ for a draw of 15K, then after the 1st phase I get a draw of another 15% and so on. That is where debt and loan differ because the debt is what you are paying interest on (the outstanding balance) which reflects a cumulative sum of draw minus any principal repayments. The difference between these is to be explained at a future session. A given tranche will observe all of the requirements of a credit facility. It has additional requirements. So a Credit Facility has multiple tranches. It does not inherit Amount. Credit Facility Amounts are distinct from Tranche Amount. 14 July: Credit Faciliy versus Committed Credit Facility. Recall that a non committe credit facility implies no commitment on the part of the potential lender. Once they are committed to it, that's a contractual commitment. However, before they do that, they assess your credit (and/or collateral or other forms of interest). What happens as time goes along? There are Ts and Cs in the facility, including a termination date (and general temrination clauses). Are there general termination clauses for instance for changes to circumstances? there is an Evergreen concept, whereby the(potential) lender has the right to revise the Ts and Cs, and terminate the loan, on a given, pre-stated review date. So the Evergreen term has conditions about what happens to outstanding loans and so on. the bank will structure lending to be able to get out as required, for example the loan may not go on beyond the Evergreen review date. This is not hard and fast though - the proviedr of the facility manages this and decides accordingly. May noe be all that obvious to the borrower what happens. Meanwhile, with revolving facility there is by definitoin a review date. Modeling: Add these (Evergreen) etc. terms to the terms for the committed credit facility. There might be conditions in the lending agreement that say how we will handle that. Are there terms i nthe Loan contract itself that refer back tot hese? Yes. The Loan Documentation will reference the Credit Facility. Compare with ISDA Master Agreement. Are there also Termination clases based on default events? (as per ISDA MA)? Most likely. These will be defined in the loan agreement. The pre-agreed terms, these are the Conditions Precedent (see elsewhere in the model) The Conditions Precedent are those things that have ot happen before the loan comes into play, for example stumping up collaterial, setting up ESCROW accounts and that kind of thing, that have to happen before the FACILITY comes into existence. So there are Conditions Precedent to the Facility, and Conditions Presedent to the Loan. So for instance negative pledges etc. - during the life of the loan you would have to confirm that you are in compliance with the conditions in the NEgative Pledge agreement. These will be Conditions Subsequent. Are there \"Conditions Precedent\" to the loan itself? Seemingly not. The loan is committed. for a non committed Credit Facility (e.g. general loan, auto loan, mortgage, lent to individuals), there are no Conditions Precedent because the bank either agrees the loan or they do not. Even for a single up front loan, there is in principle a Credit Facility which is immediately drawn down. So during that initial (intra day) period of time, there is a committed credit facility. So there is always a committed Credit Facility even if it's only transient before it is drawn down. So Credit Facility may be committed or not. but all loan are drawn down from Committed Credit Facility, even if that commitment is only transient i.e. the loan is dranw down right away. In this case, the commitment is discharged right away as a draw down. So the existence of a fee, only applies to committed credit facility tranches which are not transient. The \"fees\" as such are embedded in the interest rate. Whatever costs are incurred are passed right through as interest rate. Whereas, with credit facilitie that exist for a time, there are additional costs, and these are passed on as fees. This is the logic of having \"undrawn fees\". Example: Overdraft facility has a fee, which even if you don't use the overdraft, they charge you an undrawn fee. At the bank's discretion they might not charge fo rhtis, but recover the costs elsewhere. They may also have restrictions on whether you can have it there unused and so on. Modeling: Can construct almost any of these in whatever combination. So make sure that the model bears this out. So going into the Credit Facility is: - credit checking - Collateral - Security Interest as a general term these are, in common, all \"Credit Control\" or credit min=tigation features. Guaranties are another. CDS is also a form of guaranty, where someone guarantees that the other party will pay. Or it may take the form of some ownership transfer (?) Default: activates a Credit Support Agreement. Default event triggers the credit support agreement between the lender and the potential borrower (or a third party - see Guaranty), describing what the borrower (por other party) says the lender can do in the event of default. See Credit Support Agreements as a whole - we should model these. Also relates to the posting of collateral in OTC swaps and the like. This is also where central counterparties provide a mechanism for centralizing the risk of these. The central agency is holding the securities that each party has posted in their Master Agreement with the central counterparty (e.g. clearing house). Guaranties create contagion." ;

By law, the appointments must yield a 'fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country,' and no two Governors may come from the same Federal Reserve District.

The full term of a Governor is 14 years; appointments are staggered so that one term expires on January 31 of each even-numbered year. A Governor who has served a full term may not be reappointed, but a Governor who was appointed to complete the balance of an unexpired term may be reappointed to a full 14-year term.

Once appointed, Governors may not be removed from office for their policy views. The lengthy terms and staggered appointments are intended to contribute to the insulation of the Board--and the Federal Reserve System as a whole--from day-to-day political pressures to which it might otherwise be subject.

In addition to serving as members of the Board, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board serve terms of four years, and they may be reappointed to those roles and serve until their terms as Governors expire. The Chairman serves as public spokesperson and representative of the Board and manager of the Board's staff. The Chairman also presides at Board meetings. Affirming the apolitical nature of the Board, recent Presidents of both major political parties have selected the same person as Board Chairman.""" ;

Here the SEC is concerned primarily with promoting the disclosure of important market-related information, maintaining fair dealing, and protecting against fraud.
     Crucial to the SEC's effectiveness in each of these areas is its enforcement authority. Each year the SEC brings hundreds of civil enforcement actions against individuals and companies for violation of the securities laws. Typical infractions include insider trading, accounting fraud, and providing false or misleading information about securities and the companies that issue them.
     One of the major sources of information on which the SEC relies to bring enforcement action is investors themselves - another reason that educated and careful investors are so critical to the functioning of efficient markets. To help support investor education, the SEC offers the public a wealth of educational information on this Internet website, which also includes the EDGAR database of disclosure documents that public companies are required to file with the Commission.
     Though it is the primary overseer and regulator of the U.S. securities markets, the SEC works closely with many other institutions, including Congress, other federal departments and agencies, the self-regulatory organizations (e.g. the stock exchanges), state securities regulators, and various private sector organizations. In particular, the Chairman of the SEC, together with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, serves as a member of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets.""" ;

For example, someone might write himself a check as a simple means of transferring funds from one bank account to another. In this case, the drawer and payee are the same person. When a draft guarantees payment for goods in international trade, it is called a bill of exchange. A draft can require immediate payment by the second party to the third upon presentation of the draft. This is called a sight draft. Checks are sight drafts. In trade, drafts often are for deferred payment. An importer might write a draft promising payment to an exporter for delivery of goods with payment to occur 60 days after the goods are delivered. Such drafts are called time drafts. They are said to mature on the payment date. In this example, the importer is both the drawer and the drawee. Definition source: riskglossary.com"@en ;

    owlnames:explanatoryNote """Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.

Whether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:

(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.

(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.

(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve., Note that this does not necessarily imply that an agent is free to act as it sees fit, without constraint. Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals.""" ;

The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.

The ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.

Many countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car.""" ;

A common law system is a legal system that gives great potential precedential weight to common law, on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions. The body of precedent is called common law and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a matter of first impression), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent. Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts., A jurisdiction which is based in Common Law will also have alongside a legislature that passes statutes.""" ;

If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5)." ;

The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise., Statistical agencies implement the Laspeyres index by putting it into price-relative (price change from the base period) and revenue-share (from the base period) format. In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances.

This is an incentive to complete the construction works. Notes from PoC reviews, discussing Maximum Balance concept: In a Construction Loan you agree a maximum amount that you could draw. As you progress with the construction you continue to draw more and more. So you start with the minimum. Example: for purpose of construction of a house you could need to borrow up to 500K and the bank establishes the milestones at which certain amounts are made availalbe and can be drawn. For instance prior to start you might draw 10%, (50K); the next 50K would be available to draw only once the foundations are laid. And so on. Milestones may include \"Frame standing\" (for American-style frame based houses). Each stage requires inspection on behalf of the bank. So you are starting with no more than 10% (in this example) of what is allowable, and could arrive to the full 500K by the end of ths construction but it is not mandated that you arrive to that.

Lender rights are: - expressed in the Contract Consumer protection develops becaues the contract is written by the potential Lender. So the rights are introcued to rectify the imbalance between the two parties. Same goes for insurance. consumer protection laws (governe dby the relevant consumer protection agency. So the lender protexts itself as it writes th contract AND does the things it needs to do to protext itself, but on the approval process, and with later instruments such as insurance. Interestingly., it is the Borrower who pays for this by paying for credit reports etc. So the borrower protects itself by other mechanisms. Caveat emptor - displaced by regulation (the buyer is protected by regulation). Uberimae Fidae - in the utmost good faith. Mortgage Insurance is an additional means of mitigating the risk, that the lended may have., so if the information assessed is not accurate, or if the borrower's situation changes for the worse. then the risk rating may go down. So the Mortgage Insurance is a further strategy which mitigates any shortfall in the Lender Righrs that you may have - ie someone guarantees. In the US you can also avoid that by having paid a deposit. PIMI: Principal, Interst and Morgage Insurance. So the Borrower pays towards the MI, esxcept if they have paid a given amount as deposit. there are 2 types of MI: 1. protects the lender in the event of borrower degault 2. Insurance for \"Incapacity to pay the mortage\" (these can be bought off the shelf - can combine health, unemployment etc.). - this is the Borrower mitigating their own risk. Prevents foreclosure. Similar to general sickness etc. Where the lender charges for MI, the cost is passed onto the Borrower. e.g. if there is a % valuation (e.g. 70% in Aus, 80% in US for example) then no insurance is required."@en ;

For student loans, they can apply for a deferment payment based on change in circumstances e.g. if losing job, or becoming disabled, then there are specific programs which they can apply for. can defer paymen for a time, and if proven eligible (e.g. also if in military, being deployed), then if they subbut the relevant document, they approve and change their repayment term, perhaps temporarily and then revert to the previously agreed terms. This results from the borrower contacting the lender." ;

    owlnames:explanatoryNote "These are assessed by the servicer on a regular basis. For example monthly. the Loan servicer assesses information about the borrower once a month or... If payment is once a month, then once a month you make the payment, the information goes to the Servicer (whether or not thi is the originating bank). They keep a running total. they decrement the principal and so on. So this is monthly because the payments are monthly. They have the reports of the monies received and so on. All this is provided to the Conservatorships (where this happens) ,and are kept as individual records there AND are aggregated for accounting and risk management purposes. For securities, need to go down to the quality level of the individual loans when they put then in the pools. Further to this: this is for dynamic MBS / ABS securities (dynmaic versus static loan pools and securities based on these). If it's fixed and is in place and being serviced, there is no way to change the terms of the security. If it defaults, then the original contract is defective. with dynmaci, similar to managed CDO in that the content of the pool can be changed. Earlier note Fannie Mae: the initial assessment of the borrower in terms of Credit worthiness and financial status. taken by the broker organization. the financial status of the borrower, as well as down payment, credit rating etc. is taken into account by \"Pre-approval\". Preappoval means the broker is submitting the loan to Fannie Mae with the idea that it would meet the criteria to be purchasable by Fannie Mae. When all this is verified these are sent to Fannie Mae and then we have \"agreements\" or \"commitments\" that are in the pipeline - in the process of being processed or closed, then there are x many fixed, variable and so on. Then Fannie Mae will estimate how many loans it will be purchasing by aggregating all those. Meanwhile: Loan servicing - if this identified late payments or missed payments, then there may be another assessment of the borrower's credit worthiness. If going into foreclosure, would be another assessment. Once the loans are purchased, the concerns are simply calculating LTV (on property side, for a mortgage), which changes with payment and market value. Gets aggregated for various kinds of risk assessment and exposure assessment. The reporting by the servicer is monthly regardless of the payment frequency of the loan. Corporate versus Personal: Are the same kinds of facts assessed? Is the assessment still monthly? Agency (conservatorship): as above, once the loan is in a pool, the servicer reports to them. ALSO: If the loan is transferred from one pool etc. to another. Meanwhile: Borrower may be any Legal Entity, even for agency loans. they capture the party role, the relationship between the party and a security, and the relationship between a party and a pool of loans. Allows for a range of kinds of party. See tables of info on loan pools. 35 logical tables about the loan itself. Borrower (in old common data model in Fannie) for Borrower, has credit, per loan the mortgage insurer, the originator of the loan (bank, underwriter, brokerage etc.), the appraiser (of the property i.e. real estate, for mortgage), and for Loan borrower, the Borrower Type Code, whether ever bankrupt, amount of doan payment, borrower details, depth (Borrower v Borrower Liabilities); business expenses, Review notes: Identify the things about corporations that extend to persons and vice versa.

However, analytics that refer to this e.g. Yield to Average Life, then this figure is relevant. It is not relevant for other types of bond where e.g. you would use yield to next call, yield to worst etc. Average Life used in place of Maturity for Yield Calculation. This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it's a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life. For Student Loans, Credit Card, Loan etc, i.e. all Pool Backed (any bond that has securitized debt). Other bonds: Sinking Funds etc., also Early Payment - partial Call for a corporate / regular bond. Early Payment for pass through has the same effect. Sinking Fund: Each payment is part principal and part interest, this is implicit in the overall definition of \"Early payment\"." ;

The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or \"any\" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio.

    owlnames:explanatoryNote "In Debt pricing, Spreads are used because it's easier to quote things in a stable way, and it reflects the relative value of the thing. This is a spread of yields between the instrument so priced and the reference instrument. This spread is the mechanism by which the price is determined in yield terms, as the annualised interest rate that a investor requires for an investment. A yield is expressed as the annualised interest Rate that a investor requires for an investment. In the case of a loan the terms are set up so that the interest rate (coupon) equals that required yield and therefore the present value is equal to the loan principal. For a security, however the coupon rate is already determined so the required yield is applied to the projected cash flows in order to calculate a present value ( the price an investor is prepared to pay for the specified cash flows) Typically the required yield for a debt security is the yield to maturity. Note that this may be a discount or premium. Using the Spread lets you calculat e a yield from another observed yield as follows: Yield 1 = risk free yield Spread is to Yield 2 which is the instrument you are pricing. Earlier notes from Strucured finance review of prices quoted in relative terms: The price quoted in reference to an index e.g. LIBOR+50bp i.e. the yield. (the rate which is currently LIBOR)+50 is the price, and 50bp is the spread. e.g. Price:101% Yield = Benchmark + spread Price of 101% can be expressed as LIBOR+50 or Treasury+20 so these are separate ways of expressing the same thing. The one thing which is the price is expressed in these different ways. note also that unlike equities there's not a range of different price results from this. Spread = analytic. Bond has Price + yield. then compared to today's 90 day treasury value it's Spread is X, compared with (1 month) LIBOR its spread is Y and so on. Notes origin:NAB and SMER" ;

To protect investors from possible bankruptcy of the corporation, there are three legal safeguards: - Transfer of assets from the corporation is a non-recourse, true sale. - Investors receive a perfected interest in the assets' cash flows. - A non-consolidation legal opinion is obtained certifying that assets of the trust or special purpose vehicle cannot be consolidated with the corporation's assets in the event of bankruptcy. These same safeguards allow the corporation to remove the assets from its balance sheet. The corporation generally continues to service the assets - collecting interest and principal payments, pursuing delinquencies, etc. It is paid out of asset cash flows for providing these ongoing services."@en ;

Some inflation bonds only do this on interest, some only on interest, but most apply it to the principal and interest. Coupon interest calculated based on the adjusted amount of the bond. so a fixed coupon rate is multiplied by e.g. 1010 in the example above. Variations e.g. Italy - daily published factor published for that bond, whereas other calculate based on underlying index. Typically a CPI or a statistical number generated by the govt. typically a lagging three month index. See UK bonds on this. US and Japanese ones - look at inflation rate 3 months prior.

Reverse repo is a term used to describe the opposite side of a repo transaction. The party who sells and later repurchases a security is said to perform a repo. The other party - who purchases and later resells the security - is said to perform a reverse repo. While a repo functions like the sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, but the legal reality and the economic effect is that of a secured loan. This is a loan as the original owner retains the rights to the cashflows of the underlying security. Economically, the party purchasing the security makes funds available to the seller and holds the security as collateral. If the repoed security pays a dividend, coupon or partial redemptions during the repo, this is returned to the original owner. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices paid for the security represent interest on the loan. Indeed, repos are quoted as interest rates. A repo always pays interest at maturity i.e. there are no periodic interest payments.
